Features:
- JS Api with suspending functions
- pure Kotlin version of console (.log, .warn, ...) with
  * varargs JsonObjectWrapper (debug)
  * varargs String (release)
- JsValue.fromNativeValue<T: Any?>(v: T)
- Small app for performance tests

Performance:
- Long-based JsValue (*)


(*) Long-based JsValue
----------------------

While convenient to use, using String to identify a JsValue is inefficient because:
- it needs to be transfered/converted from/to JNI 
- it must be mapped from a string to its actually value

Using a jlong would improve those cases and might also be used to directly map QuickJS JSValue.
