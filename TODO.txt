(*) Long-based JsValue
----------------------

While convenient to use, using String to identify a JsValue is inefficient because:
- it needs to be transfered/converted from/to JNI 
- it must be mapped from a string to its actually value

Using a jlong would improve those cases and might also be used to directly map QuickJS JSValue.
